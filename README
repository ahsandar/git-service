This is a git service to help you checkout git repository and checkout branches
or tags based on supplied name. Branch has precedence over tag, If branch is not
found it checks for tag. In case none is found falls back to master. It cleans up 
the repo after you have performed operations on the repo. So it can be used to checkout 
repos to be processed and then reset any changes so multiple versions or operations can be done
based on requirement on the base source.
It will checkout source only if itdoesn't finds the a copy already otherwise only pulls changes.

 
It use CommandService and LogService to achieve all of it that can be found in the following links 

CommandService https://github.com/ahsandar/command-service.git
LogService git@gitlab.com:ahsan.dar/log-service.git
